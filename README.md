Two assignments for Artificial Intelligence class. 

Part 1: The purpose of this assignment is to implement two search algorithms (the breadth ﬁrst search and the A∗ algorithms) to solve the 8-puzzle problem (See our text-book). The goal state is given by:

1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 -

For the A∗ algorithm use the number of misplaced tiles as the heuristic function and assume that the cost of every move is 1. Generate 3 possible initial conditions randomly. Note that the problem is not solvable from every initial condition. By varying the seeds of the random number generator, make sure that your implemented algorithms can ﬁnd solutions to at least 2 of the 3 initial conditions. Please make sure your codes compile and run on the CS unix system. Submit your source code (including well-documented comments) and a 1-page write-up on the results and analysis. Mutual consultation is OK, but you should not copy codes from each other or from any other source. Your implementation should be entirely your own.

Part 2: The University of California, Irvine has a Machine Learning benchmark dataset collection available on the Web (see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Your objective is to choose the so-called “Iris” data set (see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) from the available datasets, choose two data analysis methods i.e., neural nets and decision trees, apply the two methods on the given dataset and compare the results of analysis by the two methods. You are required to submit a brief report (hardcopy) on the assignment with the following structure:

I. Problem Statement and Description (about half a page) 
II. Brief Description of the Two Methods Used (about half a page) 
III. Experimental Results (about 1 page) 
IV. Discussion of Results (about 1 page).
